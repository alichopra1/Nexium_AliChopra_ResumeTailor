Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/alichopra1/Resume_Tailor.git
cd Resume_Tailor


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=your_site_url
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://resumetailorn8n-production.up.railway.app/webhook/tailor-resume
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string


Run the Development Server:

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Supabase Setup:

Create a Supabase project and set up a resumes table with columns: id, original_text, tailored_text, job_description, feedback, created_at.
Configure Supabase authentication to enable magic link login.


MongoDB Setup:

Set up a MongoDB database (e.g., via MongoDB Atlas or a local instance).
Create a collection for user data (e.g., users) to store user profiles and preferences.
Ensure the MONGODB_URI in .env.local points to your MongoDB instance.


n8n AI Logic:The AI-driven resume tailoring logic is implemented in a separate n8n repository: alichopra1/n8n_Resume_Tailor. Follow the setup instructions there to configure the n8n workflow, which is called by the /api/tailor-resume endpoint.
